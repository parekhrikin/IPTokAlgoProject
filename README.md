IPTOK is an easy-to-use platform that allows people to easily rent IPs out using blockchain technology. In the past, renting out IPs has been an expensive and extensive task that is difficult for Alice or bob when they have a big idea. Right now, the conventional IP lending process requires a client to talk to a lending broker, then the lending broker gets in contact with the owner of the IP, and then the client and owner discuss the terms of the lending contract. with IPTOK, an easy-to-use, on-chain marketplace that allows people to shop for IPs just like they would for conventional NFTs. We are Using Algorand because it's an incredibly fast and inexpensive blockchain network that has an incredible wealth of developer tools for us to use. with IPTOK, the next generation of IP lending will be far faster, more secure, and cheaper than ever before.
